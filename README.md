# 🌐 Web Development Practice

This repository is a collection of my **web development practice snippets** and code exercises covering the core technologies I’ve explored over the past year. While the repo is newly created, it reflects consistent hands-on learning and experimentation across both frontend and backend stacks, over a year.

## 🧠 Tech Stack Covered

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
- **Templating**: EJS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Library/Framework**: React.js

## 📁 About This Repo

- Contains practice files, UI experiments, and backend concepts.
- No complete projects included — those are hosted separately in other repositories
- This is purely for showcasing the skills I’ve honed through regular practice and learning.

## 🛠️ Purpose

To track, reflect, and improve on the skills I've built in:
- Building UIs
- REST APIs
- Dynamic templating
- Styling systems
- Full-stack web architecture

> 🚀 This repo is a reflection of the learning journey, not the destination. Projects speak elsewhere, this is the workshop.
